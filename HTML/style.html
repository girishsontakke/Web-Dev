		<p>Hello Friend </p>
		<p>When <span>the sultan</span> of Bijapur <span class="another">in 1659</span> sent an army of 20,000 under
			Afẕal Khan to defeat him, Shivaji, pretending to be intimidated, enticed the force deep into difficult
			mountain terrain and then killed Afẕal Khan at a meeting to which he had lured him by submissive appeals.
			Meanwhile, handpicked troops that had been previously positioned swooped down on the unwary Bijapur army and
			routed it. Overnight, Shivaji had become a formidable warlord, possessing the horses, the guns, and the
			ammunition of the Bijapur army.</p>
